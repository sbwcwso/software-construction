      The purpose of this problem set is to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       introduce the tools we will use in 6.005, including Java, Eclipse, JUnit, and Git;
      </li>
      <li>
       introduce the process for 6.005 problem sets;
      </li>
      <li>
       and practice basic Java and start using tools from the Java standard library.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You should focus in this problem set on writing code that is
      <strong>
       safe from bugs
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       easy to understand
      </strong>
      using the techniques we discuss in class.

            Right now, we can use the
            <code>
             main
            </code>
            method plus some visual inspection to verify that our implementation is correct.
More generally, programs will have many dozens of methods that need to be tested; visually inspecting output for each one is fragile, time-consuming, and inherently non-scalable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead, we will use
            <em>
             automated unit testing
            </em>
            , which runs a suite of tests to automatically test whether the implementations are correct. 
For this problem set, we will write unit tests for methods that do not draw graphics on the screen; unit-testing GUIs is a more complex problem.

             </a>
             is a widely-adopted Java unit testing library, and we will use it heavily in 6.005.
A major component of the 6.005 design philosophy is to decompose problems into minimal, orthogonal units, which can be assembled into the larger modules that form the finished program.
One benefit of this approach is that each unit can be tested thoroughly, independently of others, so that faults can be quickly isolated and corrected as code is rewritten and modules are configured.
Unit testing is the technique of writing tests for the smallest testable pieces of functionality, to allow for the flexible and organic evolution of complex, correct systems.
            </p>
            <p>
             By writing thoughtful unit tests, it is possible to verify the correctness of one’s code, and to be confident that the resulting programs behave as expected.
In 6.005, we will use JUnit version 4.

           <div data-outline="anatomy_of_junit">
            <p>
             JUnit unit tests are written method by method.
There is nothing special a class has to do to be used by JUnit; it only need contain methods that JUnit knows to call, which we call
             <em>
              test methods
             </em>
             .
Test methods are specified using
             <em>
              annotations
             </em>
             , which may be thought of as keywords (more specifically, they are a type of metadata), that can be attached to individual methods and classes.
Though they do not themselves change the meaning of a Java program, at compile- or run-time other code can detect the annotations and make decisions accordingly.
Though we will not deeply explore annotations in 6.005, you will see a few important uses of them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look closely at
             <code>
              RulesOf6005Test.java
             </code>
             , and note the
             <code>
              @Test
             </code>
             that precedes method definitions.
This is an example of an annotation.
The JUnit library uses this annotation to determine which methods to call when running unit tests.
The
             <code>
              @Test
             </code>
             annotation denotes a test method; there can be any number in a single class.
Even if one test method fails, the others will be run.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unit test methods can contain calls to
             <code>
              assertEquals
             </code>
             , which is an assertion that compares two objects against each other and fails if they are not equal,
             <code>
              assertTrue
             </code>
             , which checks if the condition is true, and
             <code>
              assertFalse
             </code>
             , which checks if the condition is false.
             <a href="http://junit.org/javadoc/latest/index.html?org/junit/Assert.html">
              Here is a list of all the assertions supported by JUnit
             </a>
             .
If an assertion in a test method fails, that test method returns immediately, and JUnit records a failure for that test.

Double-clicking on a line in the failure stack trace will bring up the code for that frame in the trace.
This is most useful for lines that correspond to your code; this stack trace will also contain lines for Java libraries or JUnit itself.

This is one important aspect where Git is different from centralized systems such as Subversion and CVS.

          Logo
         </a>
         is a programming language created at MIT that originally was used to move a robot around in space.
Turtle graphics, added to the Logo language, allows programmers to issue a series of commands to an on-screen “turtle” that moves, drawing a line as it goes.
Turtle graphics have also been added to many different programming languages,
         <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html">
          including Python
         </a>
         , where it is part of the standard library.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the rest of problem set 0, we will be playing with a simple version of turtle graphics for Java that contains a restricted subset of the Logo language:

        <ul>
         <li>
          <code>
           forward(units)
          </code>
          <br>
           Moves the turtle in the current direction by
           <em>
            units
           </em>
           pixels, where units is an integer.
Following the original Logo convention, the turtle starts out facing up.
          </br>
         </li>
         <li>
          <code>
           turn(degrees)
          </code>
          <br>
           Rotates the turtle by angle
           <em>
            degrees
           </em>
           to the right (clockwise), where degrees is a double precision floating point number.
          </br>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         You can see the definitions of these commands in

         in package
         <code>

        <p>
         Your task is to implement
         <code>
          drawSquare(Turtle turtle, int sideLength)
         </code>
         , using the two methods introduced above:

         method in
         <code>

         .
The
         <code>
          main
         </code>
         method in this case simply creates a new turtle, calls your
         <code>
          drawSquare
         </code>
         method, and instructs the turtle to draw.
Run the method by going to
         <em>
          Run → Run As… → Java Application
         </em>
         .
A window will pop up, and, once you click the “Run!” button, you should see a square drawn on the canvas.

            <code>
             calculateHeadings
            </code>
            <br>
             Make sure to use your
             <code>
              calculateHeadingToPoint
             </code>
             implementation here.
For information on how to use Java’s
             <code>
              List
             </code>
             interface and classes implementing it, look up
             <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/?java/util/List.html">
              <code>
               java.util.List
              </code>
             </a>
             in the Java library documentation.
Note that for a list of
             <em>
              n
             </em>
             points, you will return
             <em>
              n-1
             </em>
             heading adjustments; this list of adjustments could be used to guide the turtle to each point in the list.
For example, if the input lists consisted of
             <code>
              xCoords=[0,0,1,1]
             </code>
             and
             <code>
              yCoords=[1,0,0,1]
             </code>
             (representing points (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1)), the returned list would consist of
             <code>
              [180.0, 270.0, 270.0]
             </code>
             .

            In this function, you have the freedom to draw any piece of art you wish.
Your work will be judged both on aesthetics and on the code used to draw it.
Your art doesn’t need to be complex, but it should be more than a few lines.
Use helper methods, loops, etc. rather than simply listing forward and turn commands.

           of the kinds of images you can generate procedurally with turtle graphics, though note that many of them use more commands than what we’ve provided here.
