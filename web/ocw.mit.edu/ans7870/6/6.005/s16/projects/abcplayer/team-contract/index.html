      A team contract is an agreement between you and your teammates about how your team will operate — a set of conventions that you plan to abide by.  The questions below will help you consider what might go into your team contract.  You should also think back to good or bad aspects of team project experiences you’ve already had.
     </p>
     <p>
      Below are some questions to consider. Your contract doesn’t have to answer all the questions below, but
      <strong>
       must answer at least the boldfaced questions
      </strong>
      .  Focus on the issues that your team considers most important.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       All team members should write their names at the end of the contract
      </strong>
      , to indicate that they agree with it.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       A skimpy team contract is a bad idea.
      </strong>
      If you have very little in your team contract, and your team has problems working together later in the group project, then your TA will not be sympathetic to your plight.
